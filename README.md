# Tic-Tac-Po

This repository contains a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using `tkinter` for the GUI and `numpy` for game logic. The `gui.py` script sets up the game window and board, providing an intuitive interface for users to play. The `py/board.py` script manages the game logic, including handling moves and checking for a winner. The computer opponent uses a basic random strategy, giving human players a fair chance to win.

To install, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Run the game by executing `python gui.py`. Contributions are welcome via pull requests. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
